This is a Portfolio Website, created for myself. I used Jekyll, a static site generator, which is built on Ruby. My website is hosted using GitHub pages, with CloudFlare being my DNS. The hostname is rented yearly. 

TO DO:
1. Only highlight the title of projects on hover, not the description
2. Find a more attractive nav/footer background color. Perhaps a gradient.
3. Add a function to scroll through projects so that only a few are visible at once.
4. Make personal logo and insert it somewhere into the website.
5. Make the website's project card a live display of the user's screen, or at least a live version of the website.
6. Every time someomne clicks the website's project card the page changes slightly, becoming more and more distorted.
7. Add a 404 page
8. Make pages for every project that pull from GitHub, instead of just linking to GitHub.
9. Fit 
10. Pull Description and image from GitHub repo instead of md file.

I hope to use this website as an interactive Resume of sorts. Perhaps I will eventually use it as a blog, which is the stated purpose of Jekyll.
