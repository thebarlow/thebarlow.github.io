This is a Portfolio Website, created for myself. I used Jekyll, a static site generator, which is built on Ruby. My website is hosted using GitHub pages, with CloudFlare being my DNS. The hostname is rented yearly at the moment. 

I hope to use this website as an interactive Resume of sorts. Perhaps I will eventually use it as a blog, which is the stated purpose of Jekyll.
